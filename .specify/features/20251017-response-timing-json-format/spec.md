# Feature Specification: Response Timing Display and JSON Formatting

## Overview

**Feature Name**: Response Timing Display and JSON Formatting

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Status**: Draft

**Priority**: Medium

## Problem Statement

Two user experience improvements are needed in the Tunder Client interface:

1. **Response Timing Visibility**: Users currently cannot see how long their HTTP requests take to complete. This information is valuable for performance monitoring, debugging slow requests, and understanding API response times.

2. **JSON Formatting Convenience**: Users need to manually format JSON request bodies, which is time-consuming and error-prone. A quick formatting button would improve productivity and reduce formatting errors.

These enhancements will improve the developer experience by providing better visibility into request performance and streamlining JSON editing workflows.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Scenario 1: Monitoring Request Performance

**Actor**: API Developer

**Goal**: Understand how long API requests take to complete

**Steps**:
1. User sends an HTTP request using Tunder Client
2. Response is received and displayed
3. User looks at the response header area
4. User should see the request duration displayed next to the HTTP status code

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Request duration is clearly visible next to the status code
- Duration is displayed in an appropriate unit (milliseconds for fast requests, seconds for slower ones)
- Timing information helps identify slow requests at a glance

**Current Issue**: No timing information is displayed, making it difficult to assess request performance

### Scenario 2: Formatting JSON Request Body

**Actor**: API Developer

**Goal**: Quickly format JSON request body for better readability

**Steps**:
1. User navigates to the Body tab
2. User types or pastes unformatted JSON content
3. User clicks the format button in the top-right corner of the body editor
4. JSON content is automatically formatted with proper indentation

**Expected Outcome**:
- JSON is properly indented and formatted
- Button is easily accessible in the body editor area
- Formatting works for valid JSON content
- Invalid JSON shows appropriate error handling

**Current Issue**: Users must manually format JSON or use external tools

---

### Scenario 3: Performance Comparison

**Actor**: API Developer

**Goal**: Compare response times across different requests

**Steps**:
1. User sends multiple requests to different endpoints
2. User compares the timing information displayed for each response
3. User identifies which requests are slower than expected

**Expected Outcome**:
- Consistent timing display format across all requests
- Easy visual comparison of response times
- Clear indication of unusually slow requests

**Current Issue**: No way to compare request performance

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Display Request Duration

**Description**: Show the time taken to complete each HTTP request next to the response status code.

**Details**:
- Duration should be displayed in the response header area
- Position: To the right of the HTTP status code
- Format: Use appropriate units (ms for < 1 second, s for â‰¥ 1 second)
- Precision: Show 1-2 decimal places for sub-second durations
- Color: Use subtle styling that doesn't interfere with status code visibility
- Update: Display timing for every request, including failed requests

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Request duration is visible next to status code in response header
- Duration format is appropriate for the time range (ms/s)
- Timing is accurate and reflects actual request duration
- Display works for both successful and failed requests
- Timing information doesn't interfere with existing response display

---

### FR-2: JSON Formatting Button

**Description**: Add a formatting button to the request body editor that automatically formats JSON content.

**Details**:
- Button location: Top-right corner of the body editor area
- Button appearance: Clear, accessible icon or text button
- Functionality: Format valid JSON with proper indentation
- Error handling: Show user-friendly message for invalid JSON
- Integration: Work with existing Monaco editor functionality
- Accessibility: Button should be keyboard accessible

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Format button is visible in body editor top-right corner
- Button formats valid JSON with proper indentation
- Invalid JSON shows appropriate error message
- Button integrates with existing editor functionality
- Formatting preserves JSON content while improving readability

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance Visibility**: Users can see request duration for 100% of completed requests within 50ms of response display

2. **Formatting Efficiency**: Users can format JSON request bodies in under 2 seconds using the format button

3. **Error Handling**: Invalid JSON formatting attempts show clear error messages within 1 second

4. **User Satisfaction**: 90% of users find the timing display helpful for performance monitoring

5. **No Regression**: All existing request/response functionality continues to work without issues

---

## Assumptions

1. **Timing Measurement**: Request timing can be measured from request initiation to response completion
2. **JSON Validation**: Monaco editor can validate JSON syntax before formatting
3. **UI Space**: Sufficient space exists in response header area for timing display
4. **Performance Impact**: Adding timing measurement has negligible performance impact
5. **User Preferences**: Users prefer automatic JSON formatting over manual formatting

---

## Dependencies

- Existing HTTP request handling in `HttpClientPanel.ts`
- Monaco editor integration for JSON formatting
- Response display UI components
- Request timing measurement capabilities

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Display request duration next to HTTP status code
- Add JSON formatting button to body editor
- Implement proper error handling for invalid JSON
- Ensure timing accuracy and appropriate formatting
- Maintain existing functionality and UI consistency

### Out of Scope

- Advanced performance analytics or historical timing data
- Custom JSON formatting preferences or rules
- Timing export or reporting features
- Request timing optimization or caching
- Multiple format options (only standard JSON formatting)

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Very Fast Requests**: Ensure timing display works for requests under 1ms
2. **Very Slow Requests**: Handle requests that take several minutes appropriately
3. **Network Errors**: Display timing even when requests fail due to network issues
4. **Invalid JSON**: Handle malformed JSON gracefully with clear error messages
5. **Large JSON**: Ensure formatting works efficiently with large JSON documents
6. **Concurrent Requests**: Timing display should work correctly with multiple simultaneous requests

---

## Notes

- This feature enhances existing functionality without changing core request/response behavior
- Timing display should be subtle and not interfere with existing UI elements
- JSON formatting should follow standard industry practices for indentation and structure
- Both features should work consistently across light and dark themes
- Implementation should maintain the existing clean, professional interface design
