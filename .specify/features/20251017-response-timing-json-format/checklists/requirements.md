# Specification Quality Checklist: Response Timing Display and JSON Formatting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

---

## Validation Notes

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Specification clearly identifies two distinct user experience improvements
- Requirements are specific and testable through user interaction
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No ambiguous terms or implementation details
- Edge cases properly identified for both timing display and JSON formatting
- Scope is well-defined with clear boundaries
- Both features enhance existing functionality without breaking changes

**Readiness**: Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Run `/speckit.implement` to apply the enhancements
3. Test both features in both light and dark themes
4. Verify no regression in existing request/response functionality
