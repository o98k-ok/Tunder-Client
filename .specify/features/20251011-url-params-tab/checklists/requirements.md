# Specification Quality Checklist: URL Parameters Tab

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: 
- Spec focuses on WHAT (parse parameters, display in table) not HOW
- Clear user value: improve readability for long URLs
- Business stakeholders can understand without technical knowledge
- All mandatory sections present and complete

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- Zero clarification markers - all requirements clear
- Each FR has specific acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include metrics: 50% faster, 90% error reduction, 100% parsing accuracy
- No mention of React, Monaco, or specific APIs in success criteria
- 6 scenarios cover primary, alternative, and edge cases
- Edge cases: URL encoding, duplicate keys, empty values
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Dependencies and assumptions documented

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 6 functional requirements, each with detailed acceptance criteria
- 6 user scenarios: view/edit, add, delete, no params, encoding, duplicates
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Spec is implementation-agnostic

---

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

**Readiness**: Ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear user value proposition
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Measurable success criteria
4. Well-defined scope boundaries
5. No ambiguity in requirements

**No Issues Found**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

## Reviewer Notes

- Excellent coverage of URL parameter edge cases (encoding, duplicates, empty values)
- Success criteria are specific and measurable
- User scenarios are realistic and cover main flows
- Clear distinction between in-scope and out-of-scope features
- No technical implementation details in spec

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` immediately.
