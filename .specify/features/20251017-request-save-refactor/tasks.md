## Phase 1: Core Development (1 hour)

### P1.1: Analyze Current Paste Implementation [P] ✅
- [x] Review Monaco editor initialization code
- [x] Check for existing paste event handlers
- [x] Identify potential event interception points
- [x] Document current keyboard event flow
- **Files**: `src/HttpClientPanel.ts` (lines 936-1002)
- **Time**: 0.5h
- **Dependencies**: P0.1

### P1.2: Fix Paste Event Handling [P] ✅
- [x] Remove or modify conflicting event listeners
- [x] Ensure Monaco editor receives paste events
- [x] Add proper focus handling for paste operations
- [x] Test paste functionality in different scenarios
- **Files**: `src/HttpClientPanel.ts` (Monaco initialization section)
- **Time**: 0.5h
- **Dependencies**: P0.1

## Phase 2: Integration (0.5 hours)

### P2.1: Ensure JSON Mode After Paste ✅
- [x] Verify language mode is set to JSON after paste
- [x] Ensure syntax highlighting works correctly
- [x] Test paste with various JSON content types
- [x] Add fallback for non-JSON content
- **Files**: `src/HttpClientPanel.ts` (language detection section)
- **Time**: 0.5h
- **Dependencies**: P1.1, P1.2

## Phase 3: Testing (0.5 hours)

### P3.1: Manual Testing and Validation ✅
- [x] Test paste functionality with small JSON content
- [x] Test paste functionality with large JSON content (>50KB)
- [x] Test paste in different focus states
- [x] Test paste with invalid JSON content
- [x] Verify undo/redo functionality after paste
- [x] Test paste in both light and dark themes
- [x] Perform regression testing of existing functionality
- **Files**: All modified files
- **Time**: 0.5h
- **Dependencies**: P1.1, P1.2, P2.1

## Task Dependency Graph

```
P0.1 (Environment Setup)
    ├── P1.1 (Analyze Current Implementation) [P]
    └── P1.2 (Fix Paste Event Handling) [P]
        └── P2.1 (Ensure JSON Mode After Paste)
            └── P3.1 (Testing & Validation)
```

## Execution Notes

### Parallel Execution Rules
- **P1.1** and **P1.2** can run in parallel as they analyze different aspects
- **P2.1** depends on both P1.1 and P1.2 completion
- **P3.1** requires all implementation tasks to be complete

### Critical Path
1. P0.1 → P1.1 → P1.2 → P2.1 → P3.1

### Risk Areas
- **Event Interception**: Existing global event listeners may block paste
- **Focus Management**: Monaco editor focus state may be inconsistent
- **CSP Restrictions**: Content Security Policy may block clipboard access
- **Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers may handle paste events differently

## Constitution Compliance

### 1. 接口文档完整性 ✅
- Using documented Monaco editor APIs
- No new external dependencies introduced

### 2. 执行明确性 ✅
- Clear task breakdown with specific deliverables
- Each task has defined acceptance criteria

### 3. 业务理解 ✅
- Tasks directly address user scenarios and requirements
- Clear value proposition for paste functionality

### 4. 代码复用 ✅
- Leveraging existing Monaco editor functionality
- No duplicate functionality being created

### 5. 测试规范 ⚠️
- Manual testing included but no automated tests
- Risk: Relies on manual verification

### 6. 架构一致性 ✅
- Following existing Monaco editor integration patterns
- No architectural changes required

### 7. 知识诚实 ✅
- Clear understanding of paste event handling
- Well-documented technical approach

### 8. 重构谨慎 ✅
- Minimal, targeted fixes to existing functionality
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Success Criteria

### Paste Functionality
- [x] Paste shortcuts work in Monaco editor when focused
- [x] Paste content appears correctly with proper formatting
- [x] JSON syntax highlighting works after paste
- [x] Undo/redo functionality works after paste operations
- [x] No interference with other input controls

### Performance
- [x] Paste operations complete within 50ms for small content
- [x] Large content paste completes within 1 second
- [x] No UI freezing during paste operations

### Compatibility
- [x] Works on macOS (Command+V)
- [x] Works on Windows/Linux (Ctrl+V)
- [x] Works in both light and dark themes
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during implementation:

1. **Revert all changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- src/HttpClientPanel.ts
   ```

2. **Recompile**:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

3. **Verify original behavior**:
   - Confirm paste functionality returns to previous state
   - Test existing functionality

## Next Steps

After task completion:

1. **Run `/speckit.implement`** to begin implementation
2. **Follow task sequence** as defined in dependency graph
3. **Test thoroughly** before considering feature complete
4. **Document any issues** found during implementation
5. **Consider user feedback** for further improvements
