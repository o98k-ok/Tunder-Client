## Validation Notes

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Specification clearly identifies the bug and its impact on user experience
- Requirements are specific and testable through user interaction
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No ambiguous terms or implementation details
- Edge cases properly identified for a UI state management bug
- Scope is well-defined and limited to the specific bug fix

**Readiness**: Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`

## Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Run `/speckit.implement` to apply the bug fix
3. Test the fix in both light and dark themes
4. Verify no regression in existing parameter functionality
