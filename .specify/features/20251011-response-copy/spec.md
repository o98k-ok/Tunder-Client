**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft

---

## Overview

### Feature Summary

Add a "Copy" button in the top-right corner of the Response area to allow users to quickly copy the response body content to clipboard with one click.

### Problem Statement

Users often need to copy API response data for further analysis, debugging, or sharing. Currently, they must manually select all text in the response body and copy it, which is cumbersome especially for large responses.

### Target Users

- **API Developers**: Copying response data for debugging
- **QA Engineers**: Sharing test results
- **Backend Developers**: Analyzing API responses

## Goals and Success Criteria

### Primary Goals

1. Provide one-click copy functionality for response body
2. Give clear visual feedback on successful copy
3. Maintain clean, non-intrusive UI

### Success Criteria

2. **User Feedback**: Clear visual confirmation (toast/button state change)
3. **Reliability**: 100% copy success rate for valid responses
4. **UX**: Button is easily discoverable and accessible

### Non-Goals

- Copy headers separately

## User Scenarios

### Primary Flow: Copy Response

**Steps**:
1. User sends API request
2. Response is displayed
3. User clicks copy button in response header
4. Response body is copied to clipboard
5. Button shows "Copied!" feedback
6. User pastes response elsewhere

**Expected Outcome**: Response is successfully copied and user receives clear feedback

### Edge Case: Empty Response

**Steps**:
1. API returns empty response
2. Copy button is visible
3. User clicks copy button
4. Empty string is copied

**Expected Outcome**: Copy succeeds with empty string

### Edge Case: Large Response

**Steps**:
1. API returns 5MB JSON response
2. User clicks copy button
3. Browser copies data to clipboard

**Expected Outcome**: Large response is copied successfully
