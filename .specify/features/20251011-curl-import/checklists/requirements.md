# Specification Quality Checklist: cURL Import

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Review Notes**:
- Spec focuses on user workflows and outcomes
- Technical constraints are minimal and high-level
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Review Notes**:
- ‚úÖ **Clarification resolved**: User selected Option B - trust users to manage sensitive data
  - Assumption added: Users are responsible for managing sensitive data; documentation will include security best practices
  - No automatic scanning or warnings for sensitive headers
- All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- Edge cases (malformed input, empty input) are well-defined
- Out of scope section clearly bounds feature scope

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Review Notes**:
- ‚úÖ **All items passed**: Specification is complete and ready for planning
- Primary and alternative flows are detailed
- Success criteria include specific metrics (80% time reduction, 95% parsing accuracy, 40% adoption rate)
- All 6 functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

---

## Notes

### Validation Status: ‚úÖ **PASSED**

**Summary**: All quality checks passed. Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning.

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- **Sensitive Data Detection**: User selected Option B (trust users to manage sensitive data)
  - Added to Assumptions section
  - No implementation complexity for scanning/warnings
  - Documentation will include security best practices

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Specification complete
2. ‚úÖ All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved
3. ‚úÖ Quality checklist passed
4. üöÄ **Ready for `/speckit.plan`**
