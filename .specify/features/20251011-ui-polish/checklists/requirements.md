## Validation Notes

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Specification is clear and focused on two specific UI improvements

- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No ambiguous terms or implementation details
- Edge cases properly identified
- Scope is well-defined and limited

**Readiness**: Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`

## Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Run `/speckit.implement` to apply changes
3. Test visual changes in both light and dark themes
4. Verify no layout regressions
